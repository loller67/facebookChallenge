#Facebook #Challenge

Write Create/Update/Delete tests for a single Facebook post on Facebook (ability to
create/update/delete post using Facebook API (API tests, UI - Selenium)
Note: Please use Facebook Test Users/Pages for automation.

Tests must be written in Java/Python. Test coverage should be defined by yourself. It is
important to have proper test coverage. All tests should pass successfully.

Please, define Java/Python versions and lib versions properly via your building tool so that we
don’t need to configure it locally.

FAQ:

● Do I need to create FB app and have it been reviewed by FB?

● No, you can create Facebook Test App in your Dev Account without any reviewing
required.

● Facebook does not allow to make POST requests. Is it?

● FB does not allow to make POST to the real dev apps, but if you use Test Apps
connected to your real account it’s fully available. It was created exactly for debugging
purposes.
Also, please, use Graph API Tool to generate Page Access token with required
permissions. You need your created Test App and Created Test Page ids.
